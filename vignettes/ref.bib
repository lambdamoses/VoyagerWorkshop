               proposed by Waldh{\"o}r, and a third proposed by us in this

               the type I error probability on the test based on Moran's and
               Waldh{\"o}r's indexes. We conclude also that the test proposed
               by Oden is powerful to test risk heterogeneity, but it has
               disadvantages when the interest is solely on the spatial
               correlation of morbidity risks. In this latter case, we
               recommend using our proposed test which is more powerful than
               the usual Moran's index applied directly to the rates.",

  author   = "Luo, Qing and Griffith, Daniel A and Wu, Huayi",
  abstract = "Being a hot topic in recent years, many studies have been
              conducted with spatial data containing massive numbers of
              observations. Because initial developments for classical spatial
              autocorrelation statistics are based on rather small sample
              sizes, in the context of massive spatial datasets, this paper
              presents extensions to efficiency and statistical power
              comparisons between the Moran coefficient and the Geary ratio for
              different variable distribution assumptions and selected
              geographic neighborhood definitions. The question addressed asks
              whether or not earlier results for small n extend to large and
              massively large n, especially for non-normal variables;
              implications established are relevant to big spatial data. To
              achieve these comparisons, this paper summarizes proofs of
              limiting variances, also called asymptotic variances, to do the
              efficiency analysis, and derives the relationship function
              between the two statistics to compare their statistical power at
              the same scale. Visualization of this statistical power analysis
              employs an alternative technique that already appears in the
              literature, furnishing additional understanding and clarity about
              these spatial autocorrelation statistics. Results include: the
              Moran coefficient is more efficient than the Geary ratio for most
              surface partitionings, because this index has a relatively
              smaller asymptotic as well as exact variance, and the superior
              power of the Moran coefficient vis-{\`a}-vis the Geary ratio for
              positive spatial autocorrelation depends upon the type of
              geographic configuration, with this power approaching one as
              sample sizes become increasingly large. Because spatial analysts
              usually calculate these two statistics for interval/ration data,

  abstract = "Popular spatial autocorrelation (SA) indices employed in spatial
              econometrics include the Moran Coefficient (MC), the Geary Ratio,
              (GR) and the join count statistics (JCS). Properties of these
              first two quantities rely on spatial weights matrix definitions
              [e.g., binary 0--1 (rook or queen adjacencies), nearest
              neighbors, inverse inter-point distance, row standardized], which
              may cause confusion about output from different software
              packages; to date, JCS calculations have been using only binary
              0--1 definitions. The MC and GR expected values for linear
              regression residuals also merit closer examination; although the
              mean and other details of the sampling distribution for the MC
              are well-known, at least the details of those for the GR are not.
              The (MC + GR) sum furnishes a potential diagnostic for
              georeferenced data normality, one that warrants much further
              explication and scrutiny. The Moran scatterplot is a widely used
              graphic tool for visualizing SA; this paper formally introduces
              its Geary scatterplot counterpart (first appearing informally in
              2019), together with some comparisons of the two. Meanwhile,
              established relationships between the JCS and the MC and the GR
              need additional inspection, too, especially in terms of their
              sampling variances. Preliminary analyses summarized in this paper
              also address derived asymptotic properties as well as links with
              the single spatial autoregressive parameter of the simultaneous
              autoregressive (SAR; spatial error) and autoregressive response
              (AR; spatial lag) model specifications. This paper describes
              selected little-known features of these standard SA indices,
              furthering a better understanding of, and a more complete set of
              details about, them. Results from a myriad of empirical spatial
              economics landscapes [e.g., Puerto Rico, Jiangsu Province, Texas,
              Houston (Harris County), and the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW)
              metroplex] and a variety of planar surface partitionings
              (including the square and hexagonal tessellations, and randomly
              generated graphs) illustrate highlighted theoretical and
              conceptual traits. These include a corroboration of the
              contention in the literature that the MC more closely aligns with

               Several aspects however potentially introduce noise in the NDVI

               AVHRR GIMMS NDVI exhibits a regression slope range in better
               agreement with Terra MODIS NDVI for semi-arid areas. However,

              reduction in genome biology, with applications from personalized

              fails in spatio-temporal profiling studies. Here we present
              MEFISTO, a flexible and versatile toolbox for modeling

              between the samples are known. MEFISTO maintains the established

              reduction, interpolation, and separation of smooth from
              non-smooth patterns of variation. Moreover, MEFISTO can integrate
              multiple related datasets by simultaneously identifying and
              aligning the underlying patterns of variation in a data-driven
              manner. To illustrate MEFISTO, we apply the model to different

              SCS assigns spots to cells by adaptively learning the position of

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: The negative binomial distribution has been shown to
              be a good model for counts data from both bulk and single-cell
              RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Gaussian process (GP) regression
              provides a useful non-parametric approach for modelling temporal
              or spatial changes in gene expression. However, currently
              available GP regression methods that implement negative binomial
              likelihood models do not scale to the increasingly large datasets
              being produced by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.
              RESULTS: The GPcounts package implements GP regression methods
              for modelling counts data using a negative binomial likelihood
              function. Computational efficiency is achieved through the use of
              variational Bayesian inference. The GP function models changes in
              the mean of the negative binomial likelihood through a
              logarithmic link function and the dispersion parameter is fitted
              by maximum likelihood. We validate the method on simulated time
              course data, showing better performance to identify changes in
              over-dispersed counts data than methods based on Gaussian or
              Poisson likelihoods. To demonstrate temporal inference, we apply
              GPcounts to single-cell RNA-seq datasets after pseudotime and
              branching inference. To demonstrate spatial inference, we apply
              GPcounts to data from the mouse olfactory bulb to identify
              spatially variable genes and compare to two published GP methods.
              We also provide the option of modelling additional dropout using
              a zero-inflated negative binomial. Our results show that GPcounts
              can be used to model temporal and spatial counts data in cases
              where simpler Gaussian and Poisson likelihoods are unrealistic.

              In biology, single-cell expression studies almost always begin

              impressive power in yielding biological insights into
              neuroscience, disease study, and even plant biology. However,
              current methods do not sufficiently explore the expressiveness of
              the multi-modal SRT data, leaving a large room for improvement of
              performance. Moreover, the current deep learning based methods
              lack interpretability due to the ``black box'' nature, impeding
              its further applications in the areas that require explanation.
              Results We propose conST, a powerful and flexible SRT data
              analysis framework utilizing contrastive learning techniques.
              conST can learn low-dimensional embeddings by effectively
              integrating multi-modal SRT data, i . e . gene expression,
              spatial information, and morphology (if applicable). The learned
              embeddings can be then used for various downstream tasks,
              including clustering, trajectory and pseudotime inference,
              cell-to-cell interaction, etc . Extensive experiments in various
              datasets have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and
              robustness of the proposed conST, achieving up to 10\%
              improvement in clustering ARI in the commonly used benchmark
              dataset. We also show that the learned embedding can be used in
              complicated scenarios, such as predicting cancer progression by

              paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human breast cancer sections using a
              novel FFPE-compatible single cell gene expression workflow
              (Chromium Fixed RNA Profiling; scFFPE-seq), spatial
              transcriptomics (Visium CytAssist), and automated
              microscopy-based in situ technology using a 313-plex gene panel
              (Xenium In Situ). Whole transcriptome profiling of the FFPE
              tissue using scFFPE-seq and Visium facilitated the identification
              of 17 different cell types. Xenium allowed us to spatially
              resolve these cell types and their gene expression profiles with
              single cell resolution. Due to the non-destructive nature of the
              Xenium workflow, we were able to perform H\&E staining and
              immunofluorescence on the same section post-processing which
              allowed us to spatially register protein, histological, and RNA
              data together into a single image. Integration of data from
              Chromium scFFPE-seq, Visium, and Xenium across serial sections
              allowed us to do extensive benchmarking of sensitivity and
              specificity between the technologies. Furthermore, data
              integration inspired the interrogation of three molecularly
              distinct tumor subtypes (low-grade and high-grade ductal
              carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive carcinoma). We used Xenium
              to characterize the cellular composition and differentially
              expressed genes within these subtypes. This analysis allowed us
              to draw biological insights about DCIS progression to
              infiltrating carcinoma, as the myoepithelial layer degrades and
              tumor cells invade the surrounding stroma. Xenium also allowed us
              to further predict the hormone receptor status of tumor subtypes,
              including a small 0.1 mm2 DCIS region that was triple positive
              for ESR1 (estrogen receptor), PGR (progesterone receptor) and
              ERBB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, a.k.a. HER2)
              RNA. In order to derive whole transcriptome information about
              these cells, we used Xenium data to interpolate the cell
              composition of Visium spots, and leveraged Visium whole
              transcriptome information to discover new biomarkers of breast
              tumor subtypes. We demonstrate that scFFPE-seq, Visium, and
              Xenium independently provide information about molecular
              signatures relevant to understanding cancer heterogeneity.

              short-term, been addressed by adopting methods designed for the
              analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. Though these methods work
              well in some cases, not all necessarily translate appropriately
              to spatial technologies. A common assumption is that total
              sequencing depth, also known as library size, represents
              technical variation in single-cell RNA-seq technologies, and this
              is often normalised out during analysis. Through analysis of
              several different spatial datasets, we noted that this assumption
              does not necessarily hold in spatial molecular data. To formally
              assess this, we explore the relationship between library size and
              independently annotated spatial regions, across 23 samples from 4
              different spatial technologies with varying throughput and
              spatial resolution. We found that library size confounded biology
              across all technologies, regardless of the tissue being
              investigated. Statistical modelling of binned total transcripts
              shows that tissue region is strongly associated with library size
              across all technologies, even after accounting for cell density
              of the bins. Through a benchmarking experiment, we show that
              normalising out library size leads to sub-optimal spatial domain
              identification using common graph-based clustering algorithms. On
              average, better clustering was achieved when library size effects
              were not normalised out explicitly, especially with data from the
              newer sub-cellular localised technologies. Taking these results
              into consideration, we recommend that spatial data should not be
              specifically corrected for library size prior to analysis unless
              strongly motivated. We also emphasise that spatial data are
              different to single-cell RNA-seq and care should be taken when
              adopting algorithms designed for single cell data. \#\#\#

               increasingly being applied to understand how cancer cells and
               immune response change during tumor development, progression,
               and metastasis, as well as following treatment. Yet, existing
               analysis approaches focus on investigating small tissue samples
               on a per-cell basis, not taking into account the spatial
               proximity of cells, which indicates cell-cell interaction and
               specific biological processes in the larger cancer
               microenvironment. We present Visinity, a scalable visual
               analytics system to analyze cell interaction patterns across
               cohorts of whole-slide multiplexed tissue images. Our approach
               is based on a fast regional neighborhood computation, leveraging
               unsupervised learning to quantify, compare, and group cells by
               their surrounding cellular neighborhood. These neighborhoods can
               be visually analyzed in an exploratory and confirmatory
               workflow. Users can explore spatial patterns present across
               tissues through a scalable image viewer and coordinated views
               highlighting the neighborhood composition and spatial
               arrangements of cells. To verify or refine existing hypotheses,
               users can query for specific patterns to determine their
               presence and statistical significance. Findings can be
               interactively annotated, ranked, and compared in the form of
               small multiples. In two case studies with biomedical experts, we
               demonstrate that Visinity can identify common biological
               processes within a human tonsil and uncover novel white-blood

               spatial effects, and in doing so, tends to provide an incomplete
               understanding of a given process. In such circumstances, a
               spatial adaptation of PCA can be adopted, and to this end, this
               study focuses on the use of geographically weighted principal
               component analysis (GWPCA). GWPCA is a localized version of PCA
               that is an appropriate exploratory tool when a need exists to
               investigate for a certain spatial heterogeneity in the structure
               of a multivariate data set. This study provides enhancements to
               GWPCA with respect to: (i) finding the scale at which each
               localized PCA should operate; and (ii) visualizing the copious
               amounts of output that result from its application. An extension
               of GWPCA is also proposed, where it is used to detect

               nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i
               statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may
               be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the
               magnitude of the global statistic and to identify ?outliers,? as

               various geographic literatures concerned with spatial

               the three largest eigenvalues of a binary geographic weights
               matrix have natural interpretations. A second question asks
               whether or not the eigenvalues of a geographic weights matrix
               prove useful in understanding the sampling distribution for
               spatial autocorrelation in a given geographic landscape. A third
               question addresses the issue of spatial autocorrelation
               components of geo-refer-enced phenomena. The analysis summarized
               in this paper documents responses to these three questions.

  abstract  = "The identification of spatial structures is a key step in
               understanding the ecological processes structuring the
               distribution of organisms. Spatial patterns in species
               distributions result from a combination of several processes
               occuring at different scales: identifying these scales is thus a
               crucial issue. Recent studies have proposed a new family of
               spatial predictors (PCNM: principal coordinates of neighbours
               matrices; MEMs: Moran's eigenvectors maps) that allow for
               modelling of spatial variation on different scales. To assess
               the multi-scale spatial patterns in multivariate data, these
               variables are often used as predictors in constrained ordination
               methods. However, the selection of the appropriate spatial
               predictors is still troublesome, and the identification of the
               main scales of spatial variation remains an open question. This
               paper presents a new statistical tool to tackle this issue: the
               multi-scale pattern analysis (MSPA). This ordination method uses
               MEMs to decompose ecological variability into several spatial
               scales and then summarizes this decomposition using graphical
               representations. A canonical form of MSPA can also be used to
               assess the spatial scales of the species-environment
               relationships. MSPA is compared to constrained ordination using
               simulated data, and illustrated using the famous oribatid mites
               dataset. The method is implemented in the free software R.",

  author   = "Langfelder, Peter and Horvath, Steve",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in
              bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene
              co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for
              describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray
              samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be
              used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes,
              for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an
              intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to
              external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and
              for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks
              facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used
              to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These
              methods have been successfully applied in various biological
              contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and
              analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation
              network methodology have been described in separate publications,
              there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and
              consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
              RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive
              collection of R functions for performing various aspects of
              weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes
              functions for network construction, module detection, gene
              selection, calculations of topological properties, data
              simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external
              software. Along with the R package we also present R software
              tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene
              expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be
              applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA
              package provides R functions for weighted correlation network

               for analysis, and how attributes of geometries can relate to
               geometries. In the second part of the book, these concepts are
               illustrated with data science examples using the R language. In
               the third part, statistical modelling approaches are
               demonstrated using real world data examples. After reading this
               book, the reader will be well equipped to avoid a number of
               major spatial data analysis errors. The book gives a detailed
               explanation of the core spatial software packages for R: sf for
               simple feature access, and stars for raster and vector data
               cubes -- array data with spatial and temporal dimensions. It
               also shows how geometrical operations change when going from a
               flat space to the surface of a sphere, which is what sf and
               stars use when coordinates are not projected (degrees

  abstract = "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used to profile
              the transcriptome of individual cells. This provides biological
              resolution that cannot be matched by bulk RNA sequencing, at the
              cost of increased technical noise and data complexity. The
              differences between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data mean that the
              analysis of the former cannot be performed by recycling

              article describes a computational workflow for low-level analyses
              of scRNA-seq data, based primarily on software packages from the

              connectivity matrices (i.e., topology-based; CB) developed by D.

               variable, and its variability can be explained by the complex
               interplay among several structuring factors. The thorough

               analysis) and their spatial structure (autocorrelation).

               Mathematical Reviews as an ``excellent book which will become a
               basic reference.'' This paper-back edition of the 1993 edition,
               is designed to meet the many technological challenges facing the
               scientist and engineer. Concentrating on the three areas of
               geostatistical data, lattice data, and point patterns, the book
               sheds light on the link between data and model, revealing how
               design, inference, and diagnostics are an outgrowth of that
               link. It then explores new methods to reveal just how spatial
               statistical models can be used to solve important problems in a
               host of areas in science and engineering. Discussion includes:
               Exploratory spatial data analysis Spectral theory for stationary
               processes Spatial scale Simulation methods for spatial processes
               Spatial bootstrapping Statistical image analysis and remote
               sensing Computational aspects of model fitting Application of
               models to disease mapping Designed to accommodate the practical
               needs of the professional, it features a unified and common
               notation for its subject as well as many detailed examples woven
               into the text, numerous illustrations (including graphs that
               illuminate the theory discussed) and over 1,000 references.
               Fully balancing theory with applications, Statistics for Spatial
               Data, Revised Edition is an exceptionally clear guide on making
               optimal use of one of the ascendant analytical tools of the
               decade, one that has begun to capture the imagination of
               professionals in biology, earth science, civil, electrical, and
               agricultural engineering, geography, epidemiology, and ecology.",

               write with lucidity and charm about its traditions. When the

               public.''--Northrop Frye ``Wit, grace, style, and wisdom vie
